## The Promise and Reality of Japan's Startup World

For many in the startup world, Japan is a promised land. It's the place where Steve Jobs found zen and where Larry Ellison gained invaluable business insights. Many of us grew up watching Japanese anime and using Japanese electronics. For many, experiencing Japan is like reaching the summit of a mountain.

As a software engineer, I was particularly drawn to Japan's technological "advancements" and innovative spirit. I, too, chased this dream. Over the last decade, I made numerous trips to Japan, both for business and pleasure. I learned Japanese, made friends, and immersed myself in the tech scene. I thought I had a good grasp of the culture and knew how to work with Japanese people. However, nothing could have prepared me for the experience of building — and failing at — a startup in Japan.

Few have likely had the same experience, so instead of sharing success stories, I'd like to share my failures and what I've learned about the Japanese startup world, particularly from a software engineer's perspective. Japan remains a wonderful place to visit and enjoy, especially for tech enthusiasts. Through a series of articles, I hope to provide you, the reader, with insights to judge for yourself whether Japan is the right place for you and your entrepreneurial aspirations in the world of technology.

That's enough for today. While I don't have a set schedule for publishing new articles, I'll try to write as much as I can. Thanks to LLM, my writing isn't as terrible as it once seemed.

**Note**: My startup experience was between early 2023 and mid-2024. By the time you are reading this, the situation may have changed. I hope my articles will still be relevant and provide you with valuable insights.
